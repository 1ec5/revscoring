=======================

Right now, you need to import from `revscores.features.features`.  That's dumb. I could rename the higher-level `features` to `feature_extraction`.  That's a little verbose.  Then you'd import from `revscores.feature_extraction.features` -- which doesn't sound as dumb, but is verbose.

* revscores
    * feature_extraction
        * features
        * datasources
        * extractor
        * dependencies
    * models
        * ???
